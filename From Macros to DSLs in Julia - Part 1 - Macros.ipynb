    "Many new users find Julia's Lisp-style macros confusing. For people without experience using syntactic macros in another language, Julia's macros present several challenges: macros introduce multiple pieces of unfamiliar syntax (i.e. `@` and `$`); macros differ from functions in fairly subtle ways that make it unclear when to use which; and authoring macros requires a fairly deep understanding of Julia's syntax because Julia has a large range of expressions that can occur in normal code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this series of notebooks is to help users overcome those challenges so they can learn to write macros with confidence. By the end of the series, you should understand macros well enough to implement a DSL in Julia for yourself. In this first notebook, we won't implement any DSL's and will instead focus on writing simpler macros. But the second notebook will entirely focus on issues that arise in developing a DSL using macros.\n",

    "\n",
    "To improve your understanding of the core concepts relevant to writing macros, we're going to proceed as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We'll review Julia's representations of quoted code and consider the kinds of expressions that you'll need to be able to reason about to produce reliable macros that work correctly across a broad range of inputs.\n",
    "2. We'll learn to distinguish quotation from quasiquotation to help us understand how `$` works in macros.\n",
    "3. We'll talk about writing functions over expressions, which should be used to make macro definitions easier to read.\n",
    "4. We'll discuss what hygiene means and understand how `esc` lets you tell Julia to not enforce hygiene.\n",
    "5. We'll contrast the order in which macros are expanded with the order in which functions are evaluated.\n",
    "6. We'll discuss when to use macros instead of functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The approach we'll take is driven by focusing on examples that illustrate the core issues. Every time you see a snippet of code, think about what it does before executing it. Then execute it to check whether your understanding was correct. Keep thinking and checking until your own predictions about what should happen coincide with what happens.\n",

   "source": [
    "As we've noted repeatedly, macros are similar to functions in many ways. In general, you should use functions instead of macros whenever possible because they are easier to reason about and are more familiar to most Julia users.\n",
    "\n",
    "That said, the cases in which macros are required are outlined well in [Chapter 8 of Paul Graham's On Lisp](https://www.csee.umbc.edu/courses/undergraduate/331/resources/lisp/onLisp/08whenToUseMacros.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "In Julia, some broad classes of cases include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* You want to employ existing Julia syntax, but provide non-standard semantics that cannot be achieved through function overloading. Almost all DSL's fall under this category.\n",
    "* You want to provide a function that operates on expressions, but doesn't require the user to quote the expressions. Our `@true_quote` macro was a variant on this idea.\n",
    "* You want to force some computation to occur exactly once at compile-time. Our `@bac_macro` was a bad example of this.\n",
    "* You want to change the values bound to a variable in the caller's scope. Julia functions cannot do this, although they can mutate the contents of mutable values passed in to them as arguments. Our `@assign` macro was an example of this.\n",
    "* You want to write a function that does not evaluate all of its arguments eagerly. You'll write an example of this in the upcoming exercises.\n",
    "* You want to write a function that captures both an expression's value and the surface syntax in which it is written. This will come up in Part 2 of this series.\n",
    "\n",
    "So there are quite a few cases in which macros are useful. But it's worth remembering the limitations of macros as well:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Essentially every macro call gets translated into Julia code that does not make use of macros. The implication of this is that macros never allow you to express computations that you can't express without macros -- they are purely syntactic sugar. This makes them very different from concepts like structs, parametric types, etc. that are not immediately reducible to other existing language features. The few exceptions to this rule are macros that produce expressions as output that have no surface syntax in Julia. Our true quotation versus quasiquotation example is almost an example of this, except that there is surface syntax based on `Expr` constructors. The `@inbounds` macro in Julia is a better example in which the relevant `Expr` objects can be constructed, but could only be used in combination with `eval` to actually take effect and therefore cannot occur in normal Julia code (where normal is defined as not making use of `eval`). In general, you should assume you will write very few of these macros because they usually can't work without changes to the Julia compiler itself. As such, it is best to stick to the intuitive rule that **macros should be used to provide a more ergonomic solution to a problem than would be possible without them**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some closing tips for writing macros:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Before you write a macro, write an example of the code you want to generate.\n",
    "* Do all of the important work in functions over expressions. This is especially important if you will hit hygiene issues because the macro will produce output that may surprise you, but the function will not."
